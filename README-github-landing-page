# <b>Your Very Own GitHub Landing Page!</b>
### This quick n' dirty tutorial explains how I threw my gosh dang landing page onto the ol' information superhighway. 

<br />

If you're a Prime student, you likely had to do the 'resume challenge' to get started. As a result, you'll have a repo at `YOURNAME.github.io`. This is where we're gonna drop that new landing page. In any event ... _**Let's get crackin'!!**_

## 1. Build a landing page

I won't go into detail here - the possibilities are endless! Take your time and make it awesome. Definitely have a repository for this project and commit often.

---

## 2. Building the page directory

##### _There is some terminology here that I don't know, so I'm going to be descriptive_


When you're satisfied with your new landing page and are ready to deploy, run this following in the terminal (while inside the project directory):

        npm run build

You'll see some shiny new files appear...

---

## 3. Copy those files to your clipboard

Go find those files on your computer the old fashioned way and `CMD + C` them (Mac).

## 4. Past them into that folder in your ol' GitHub resume directory

_Prime students only:_ When you started with Prime, you built the "resume challenge" and dropped that resume at `YOURNAME.github.io`. Now that your landing page is ready for some eyeballs, it's going to replace that resume. 

_Everyone else:_ If you have anything in your `YOURNAME.github.io` directory, clean it out. Dump it. If you're obsessive like me, dump it into another temporary folder for safekeeping. THEN - paste your newly copied `build` files into that directory.

## 5. Push it real good

Finally, push the project up to that same original place. By default, it'll likely be:

        git push origin master

or possibly...

        git push origin main

---

## 6. Chiggity check it

Now is a good time to make sure things are live!

## **NOTE**:

If you're getting a white screen, take a look at your `YOURNAME.github.io` repository. Did the index.html file in the main directory successfully update? Does it have the right commit message?

### **If you don't see it or it's an older message:**

Go back into that project in VS Code, open up the index.html file in the public directory and throw a space or an enter into the file somewhere (somewhere benign - between tags or something - don't break the code!). This is a weird little trick, but it will force GitHub to see a change in the file. _**THEN start over at the top of this tutorial.**_

## _**But wait a minute...**_
I don't know about you, but I don't want to tell people to visit that URL...I want `chrismochinski.com`...I bet you want YOUR NAME dot com...right? RIGHT? Let's do it!!!

## 7. Google Domains

There are a number of places where you can score and redirect a domain. This, in my opinion, is the simplest.



### That's it! I SINCERELY hope this helps some folks. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have questions (or if you find any errors in the above 😃 )
