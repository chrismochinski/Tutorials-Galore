# HERE'S HOW WE DO THIS SERVER THINGY
---
1. ## Open terminal and pick your destination directory. Then do aaaaaallll this stuff (see image):


    - mkdir ***name-of-directory*** --- (making the file you're gonna do stuff in)
    - cd ***name-of-directory*** --- (to go into it)
    - mkdir ***server*** --- (a nice new server folder)
    - touch ***.gitignore*** --- (blocks some crap from some crap)
    - cd ***server*** --- (changes your working directory to this)
    - mkdir ***public*** --- (public folder)
    - touch ***server.js*** --- (a file of important javascrip things n' stuff)
    - cd ***public*** --- (move into the public directory)
    - touch ***index.html*** --- (here's your main html page!)
    - mkdir ***scripts*** --- (here's a folder for your javascript you'll source)
    - mkdir ***vendors*** --- (here's a folder for jQuery)
    - mkdir ***styles*** --- (and, finally, a folder for your CSS )
    - cd .. --- (goes up one level)
    - cd .. --- (you've now gone UP two levels)
    - ***code .*** --- (open all that stuff up in VS Code!)<br /><br />

2. ## Go into your new VS Code window and add...
    - ***style.css*** to your styles directory
    - ***client.js*** to your scripts directory
    - ***jQuery*** (wherever you paste it from) into your vendors directory<br /><br />

    ## ...it'll now look something like this:<br />

3. ## Do your HTML boilerplate, source your CSS/JS/JQ and make an H1 with something awesome in it. BE CAREFUL HOW/WHERE YOU SOURCE. Here is a screen grab of my FINAL HTML:

4. ## Get your butt back over to Terminal and enter:<br />
    - ***npm init --yes*** <br /><br />

    ### this is what will appear: <br /><br />
<img src="slide5-npm-init---yes.png" alt="inityes" width="400"/><br />

---

## You SUDDENTLY have a file called **package.json** in your little tree on the left in VS Code!! Open 'er up. 
    
---

5. ## After the line that starts with "test", type a comma. Then, hit enter and, on the nexts line, type the following:
    ## ***"start": "node server/server.js"*** <br /> <br />

<img src="slide6json.png" alt="json" width="500"/><br /> <br />

---

6. ## Back in TERMINAL, type the following: <br />
***npm install express***. <br /> <br />
    This will do some stuff to your tree and will drop a version at the bottom of your package.json file (mine says some crap ending with **"express": "^4.17.1"**).<br />

7. ## Good luck memorizing THIS stuff...
    Go to your server.js and type all of this (and feel free to disregard my clumsy comments) ...<br />

---

8. ## in your .gitignore file, type this:

node_modules/ <br />
.DS_Store

---

9. ## MOMENT OF TRUTH...in Terminal, type:
<br />

# ***npm start***

<img src="slide9.png" alt="it's working" width="500"/><br /> <br />

# The above is what you should see in terminal after you press ENTER...

---

10. # And here is what you should see in your index.html with the above steps -

## and, finally, in the browser when you enter ***localhost:5000*** <br /><br />

## Thanks for reading! Good luck and, if you have any questions, you know who to talk to. Um...somebody else.
